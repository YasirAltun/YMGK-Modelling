-----------

### Features

These are the main features that we will enable soon:

-   Anomaly detection
    -   Sub-Dimensional Anomaly Alert
    -   Enable Anomaly w/o Sub-Dimension
-   Code/API level configuration for
    -   Hyperparameters for any algorithms
    -   Subpopulation calculation logicÂ 
-   Alerting
    -   Backoff for alerting to minimize repeated alerts

### New ConnectorsÂ 

We will be enabling the following new connectors soon:

### Scalability & Robustness Improvements

We are working on the following to improve & support data at larger scale:

-   Data ingestion
    -   Support for materialized views across dataware houses for large scale processing
    -   Support for OLAP cube support where available
-   Data processing
    -   Distributed Sub-Dimensional Anomaly Detection
    -   Higher level of sub population supportÂ 
-   Robustness
    -   More Robust & Fault Tolerant Task Scheduler
    -   Robust Error Messages that aid in debugging
